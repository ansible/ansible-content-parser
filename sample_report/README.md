# Report Sample
(Last update: 2023-08-21) This directory contains a report output sample (`sample_report.txt`), 
which was produced using the [Ansible-OpenShift-Provisioning](https://github.com/IBM/Ansible-OpenShift-Provisioning)
repository as input. Metadata outputs from ansible-content-parser and Sage pipeline are also included
for references.

**Note:** The format of the report is not final and will be
updated later.
